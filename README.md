# Stripe – Case Study

## Overview and Origin

### Fast Facts:

Name of company: Stripe

First Incorporated: 2010

Founders: Irish entrepreneur brothers John and Patrick Collison

Employees: 2,500+

Headquarters: San Francisco, CA


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Both brothers John and Patrick Collison come from an exceptional academic background in Ireland. Patrick left High School early to attend MIT, where he already began founding companies, while John attended Harvard. The two began working on Stripe together in 2010 after debating why it was so difficult to accept payments online for their projects. They formed a goal to attempt to simplify the online payments process. 

At this stage of the industry development, it was unclear how big the market for payments was, and it was uncertain how the company could address such issues as fraud, non-US payments, and solving similar problems that Paypal does but in user-friendly way. While Stripe originally was set up to partner with other payments companies, the Collison brothers realized that the only way to develop the customer experience they envisioned was to develop the platform entirely in-house.

By the fall of 2010, the brothers were working full time on the project, by June 2011, the brand design was in production, in 2012 the company moved from Palo Alto to San Francisco, and by 2013, stripe made its first acquisition, Kickoff. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

According to Crunchbase, Stripe has raised a total of $1.6B in funding through 14 rounds of funding. Their latest funding was raised on May 28, 2020 from a Secondary Market round. The company has been valued to be in the range of $10B+ as of Apr 16, 2020, according to PrivCo. Of note, Peter Thiel was among the early funders of Stripe. 

Interestingly, Stripe continues to strive to remain a private company, while many other “unicorn” start-up firms often go public at this stage of maturity. 


## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Stripe primarily was founded as an online payments provider. While the online payments industry has grown substantially in the last decade, Stipe was an important early player in shaping the landscape for online payments. Their full suite of service offerings adds value to both merchants, businesses, and consumers in the areas of online and in-person retail, subscriptions businesses, and software platforms and marketplaces.

As the company has grown, further services related to payments have been expanded. In 2018, the company released “Radar", which is a set of anti-fraud tools that block fraudulent transactions. The company expanded its services to include billing products for online businesses, allowing businesses to manage subscription recurring revenue and invoicing abilities. Until recently, the company had been focused on online payments field specifically. However, in 2019, Stripe developed a point of sale service called Terminal, which allows merchants to run physical credit cards through a reader (similar to Square). 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  

While the payments side of the transaction is fairly straightforward for the consumer, the Collison identified a gap in service for the merchant businesses who would want to scale up their online sales operations. Stripe was therefore designed with merchants in mind. For example, when a business wants to sell products online, worrying about the payments interface and the relationships with financial institutions could be cumbersome and time consuming. For an internet business, payments is a part of the process that matters. The services offered by Stripe helps enable a product experience for merchants that is seamless and value adding. Lyft and Shopify were early customers of Stripe for these reasons. The Collison brothers have been credited with creating an overall interface and user experience that is scalable, user friendly, and was not previously available through other payment systems such as Paypal, which at that time was more designed for the consumer experience (person to person transactions, EBAY transactions, etc.). 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 

Ruby – The API (application programming interface) for Stripe utilizes the Ruby programing language.
Apache – With respect to Big Data, Stripe utilizes the Apache Hadoop software, which is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage.
Asana  - Asana is a web and mobile application designed to help teams organize, track, and manage information. The Software is designed to improve team collaboration and work management using a single tool.


## Landscape:

The landscape of the global payments domain has shifted significantly since the inception of companies like Stripe and Paypal. As the adoption of smartphone and mobile devices has grown, so has the number of consumers using “mobile wallet” apps to make purchases. This payment venue is forcing merchants to adopt mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) solutions that accept mobile wallets, contactless payments, and other digital-native products that have been adopted by consumers. Estimates expect there to be 16.6 million mPOS terminals in the U.S. by 2024.

Payments trends have accelerated even further through the COVID pandemic. With an increased amount of online retail demanded by consumers, online merchants have seen their share of business online expand at a rapid rate. Most merchants looking to adapt to these accelerating trends don’t have the time or resources to navigate the regulation and infrastructure of payment systems, especially when branching out into new markets. A single API integration to a global payments provider is the most effective way to unlock new international markets, without having to individually integrate each local payment method.  

In terms of markets for online business, the most recent accelerating in growth has come from Eastern Europe and India, which have traditionally lagged behind in e-commerce and digital payments adoption. Latin America is also anticipated to be a primary region for growth of digital payments infrastructure. 

With the increase in the overall size of the payments market, more FinTech firms have come to the scene. Traditional players and banks are merging with these FinTech firms in an effort to get even closer to their customers. Banks will acquire a POS system because they want to get a exposure to the technology side of the process. Companies like Apple have partnered with Goldman Sachs for the Apple credit card. Facebook has created its own cryptocurrency has introduced its users to Facebook Pay, which enables customers to make payments and transfer funds using their suite of apps such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. These mergers and joint ventures provide value to consumers because unlike the financial industry, technology companies are very good at creating seamless customer experiences. 

Competitors for Stripe include other FinTech companies such as Square, Paypal, ApplePay, GooglePay, Klarna, and Bluepay. Banks offer merchant services but are much less technologically integrated (as referenced above). While these companies act as competitors in some ways to traditional or incumbent banking systems, they are also seen a natural collaborative partners for these institutions, and have seen an increased number of partnerships and acquisitions. 


## Results

My most measures, Stripe has been incredibly effective in disrupting the payments industry and providing value for merchant customers. In 2020, it was named as the number 1 disruptor company by CNBC. Its growing customer base and attractiveness by large companies such as Lyft, Amazon, Slack, Glossier, Shopify, and Airbnb have contributed to its $36 billion valuation. 

Stripe has had an impressive performance since its inception as seen by its multiple rounds of increased funding and booming estimated valuation. The company has benefitted from its easy to use and maintain interface for merchants and low flat fees. 

A relative limitation for Stripe in comparison to other competitors in the field is their limited options for in-person payments. Stripe has taken active steps to overcome this gap in service by recently offering an in person terminal, though this is limited to only certain devices at this point. Further limitations include the high level of competition in the industry. 

Stripe is leveraging their current position as a leader in the competitive payments industry to expand into new areas of finance. In November the company announced the launch of a new lending division, Stripe Capital. The new venture is meant to help online companies borrow money to grow their businesses, which in turn would help Stripe’s business long term.  



## Recommendations

Business Expansion: 
While Stripe has continuous proven to be an early player in their particular service offerings, the high amount of competition in the payments industry provides the company with ample reason to differentiate themselves. Stripe is set to continue introducing additional financial services beyond payments, including lending, internal business analytics, and in person transactions. 

Regulatory Environment:
As with other financial services firms, Stripe is required to collect, verify, and maintain information on its US customers based on government regulations that are intended to promote transparency and prevent individuals from using complex company structures to hide terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion, and other financial crimes. This regulatory process can be a conflict for such a company that wants to make set-up for its customers to happen as quickly and as smoothly as possible. As with other firms in the industry, Stripe will continue to be challenged in how to meet these regulatory obligations while expanding its business. The company expand its technological resources to get ahead of these challenges, which could also have an added benefit for its Radar line of business, and present possible cross-over with its need for expanded business analytics. Machine learning technology would be a valuable investment to address each of these priorities.
